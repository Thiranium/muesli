Then when I come home, full exhausted, then I lay my head on your laps and I fall asleep while you are running your fingers through my hair then you kiss me on my forehead. 🫠🤭

Muesli's mood is off, muesli talks with sakii, muesli smiles, muesli's mood get better, muesli happy and then as a result muesli lovessss youuuu veryyyy much for these things.

            Every second we spend together, I cherish them all, be it in college, walking together, heck even when talking with you, it all feels so nice, sometimes I really wonder how could a single person make me feel this relaxed, I mean very very relaxed I get when I with you, itna ki neend aane lag jaati hai and I think you know it very well cutieeeeee. It really makes me sad when we have to part ways when the day is over and we have to go home 😔😔, why can't we just stay together at OUR house 😔😔 (inshallah in future).

            And our dates, they are the cuutiieeesttt, one of my favourite part about this is we can go on dates saath me 😚😚, I really love it when we go on dates, we get to spend time together, it all feels really nice. Our cutesttt dates were on pdp and the sexiest dates in theatre. Those weird walks we do saath me, weird things, get comfortable with each other, do some inside jokes, and ofc our dirty talks of what what we'll do or we want to do when we get a room (want to make those real so bad), that is all soo much fun man, I want all of this to last forever and ever
